# console-clock

A clock made with JavaScript which displays the time in the web console. Format is selected as HH:MM:SS.

Literally a simple project I made with JavaScript and HTML. The HTML is literally empty, just stating a source to the JS. I used VS Code to do this and I used live server (https://bit.ly/3w2voSD) to test it.

Use it when your home clock doesn't work :P
